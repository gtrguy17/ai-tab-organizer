# AI Tab Organizer
Organizes all tabs across windows into AI-generated groups. Uses your own OpenAI API.

> [!NOTE]
> **This is a fun, working experiment with Chrome and OpenAI.**
> Not only is the OpenAI API kind of slow, it sometimes groups tabs in a weird way.
> Use at your own risk.

## Features
- **AI Organize:** Organizes all tabs across windows into AI-generated groups
- **Deduplicate Tabs:** Closes all duplicate tabs
- **Close Blank Pages:** Closes all tabs that are blank pages (e.g. `about:blank`)
- **Sort Tabs by URL:** Sorts all tabs by URL, even inside groups
