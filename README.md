# AI Tab Organizer
Organizes all tabs across windows into AI-generated groups. Uses your own OpenAI API.


> [!NOTE]
> **This is just a prototype.** Not only is the OpenAI API kind of slow, it sometimes groups tabs in a weird way. Use at your own risk.

1. Download `.zip` file from https://github.com/spaceemotion/ai-tab-organizer/releases/latest
